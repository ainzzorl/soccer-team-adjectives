Scholes is absolutely nowhere near Iniesta. I have no clue why this sub loves him so much. Couldn't tackle for shit.,ddmqddb
"3 away goals is laughable, just like when we lost 4-3 against Schalke two years ago at home and Ronaldo was visibly upset. Pretty unacceptable if you want to be an elite club and are trying to win this trophy.",de1lhp0
"Bullshit, no defender is going to stop Suarez hitting that ball and loads of forwards shoot shots that keepers parry. It's fucking idiotic to give Messi credit for a goal that he MISSED.",ddgsb6a
Milik is a fucking nightmare had him for top scorer at the euros and missed about 10 gettable chances,ddr6m8v
"Plus Alaves were exhausted I think.

And their slightest defensive mistakes were punished with extreme prejudice.

I hope Alaves beat them though. It would be beautiful. ",ddr6vxg
"Good luck against the Arse. It's the magic of the FA Cup, and all those other cliches :) But I do like an underdog match. And you never know, Arsenal might even win it

"Bacca is a good player, but hugely dependent on supply. When he *is* supplied, he is one of the best strikers in the world. He doesn't add as much to the game as Ibra, Lewa, Suarez or Aguero, but I'd put him in a tier just under that. Sadly, we can't supply him. Our midfield in particular is rubbish. Can't hold a ball to save their lives. It's not that Bacca is bad, it's just that Lapadula can add just as much, or more, considering our current quality and play style. We just can't find a use for Bacca, but we sure as hell could find a use for some cash.",ddie3xv
"Strange thing to say, but to an extent one can understand this statement. Didn't he take a sabbatical because managing Barca burned him out?
If I personally went through such a stressful environment at work I'd rather not return and take the same responsibilities again.",ddvwnpv

But a counter point could have been made that you could have played the Fernando-Fernandinho pairing in midfield and ridden their early press until they ran themselves ragged in the second half and bring on a midfielder than and go for the kill.The score could have been like 3-1 instead of 5-3?,de1mywf
